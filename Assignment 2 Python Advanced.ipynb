    "# Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",

    "Ans====>Python does not support function overloading. Suppose we still want to use the feature of functional overloading. In that case, we can set the default values of parameters in the method as None, which won't give an error if that specific value is not passed as an argument while calling the function.0"

    "Ans====>It allows for reusability; instead of developing numerous methods with minor differences, we can simply write one method and overload it. It also increases code clarity and reduces complexity. Operator overloading also makes the code more concise and easier to understand."
