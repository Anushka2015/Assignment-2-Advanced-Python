    "Ans===>assert statement allows us to write sanity checks in our code. These checks are known as assertions, and we can use them to test if certain assumptions remain true while you're developing our code. If any of our assertions turn false, then we have a bug in our code."

    "Ans===>The with statement replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand. More importantly, it ensures closing resources right after processing them. A common example of using the with statement is reading or writing to a file. A function or class that supports the with statement is known as a context manager"
